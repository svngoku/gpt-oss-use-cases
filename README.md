## Using `uv` for Fast Dependency Management

We recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for lightning-fast Python dependency installation, script running, and environment management.

### Install `uv`

First, install `uv` if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install uv
```

### Install dependencies with `uv`

Instead of pip, use:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is significantly faster and more reliable for large dependency trees.

### Run scripts with `uv`

To run Python scripts with the correct environment isolation:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/your_script.py
```

You can also use `uv` to manage virtual environments and direct script execution, similar to `pipx` or `venv`.
